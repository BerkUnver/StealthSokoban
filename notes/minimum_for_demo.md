# I have ~2 months until the exhibition. What features do I need for a minimal demo there?

##### Core
- Sound
- MACOS PORT??? I really hope not.

##### Gameplay
- The ability to move between levels.
- An overworld?
- Simple tutorial levels. This may involve drawing text on the screen.
- A special demo build with features to reset the game after not being touched for a certain amount of time.

##### Graphics
- Visual distinction between moving and non-moving blocks
- Visual effects for when the player pulls blocks, pushes blocks, etc, so the player knows what is going on.
- Something better than a cube for the player model.



##### What we don't need
- We don't necessarily need working enemies.
- Editor IMGUI stuff. I want to continue working on it but it is lower-priority.
- Saving
